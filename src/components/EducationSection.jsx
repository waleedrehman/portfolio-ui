During high school I signed up for paired reading mentor for which I had to work with year 7 and year 8 students who were not fluent with English language. As part of my task, I would help these students in reading books so they can learn the language fairly quickly.<br />
As part of school I also took part in an after school drama club in which we acted out the famous Shakespeare play Romeo and Juliet. This gave me the confidence for addressing large number of crowd without hesitation.<br />
During my School education I took part in a Car Maintenance Programme which taught me how to deal with a car broke down.<br />
In this programme we were taught how to change tyres, how to fill the air in the tyres, safety checks before opening front bonnet and other small repairs.
